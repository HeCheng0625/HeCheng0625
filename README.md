### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yuancheng Wang (çŽ‹è¿œç¨‹), a third-year PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), supervised by Prof. [Zhizheng Wu](http://www.drwuz.com/). My research focuses on generative AI for speech and multimodal learning. I am currently a research scientist intern at Meta Superintelligence Labs (formerly GenAI), working on enhancing the speech capabilities of LLaMA models.

I have developed several advanced TTS models, including **NaturalSpeech 3** and **MaskGCT**, and I am one of the main contributors and leaders of the open-source Amphion *[Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion)* toolkit. My work has been published at top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, and IEEE SLT.

Previously, I have also interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and ByteDance.
